# InterpolationLagrange-Processing

This is a tiny repository about Lagrange Interpolation.

The Code was made in Java using processing.
I've compiled it in a apk if you want to try it.

to use the software (if we consider this little thing as software XD) just place points and see the program generate a function that goes through all the points.

if you place point too close of each other (in the X axis) the function may be glitched.
In general the function start to glitch around 20 points.

if you want more comment in the code or even a youtube video about it tell me in discord.
